# Deck of Cards

Application that displays a deck of cards, one card at a time.

Utilizes the [Deck of Cards API](http://deckofcardsapi.com/) for the creation of a full deck of cards.

------------------------------

__Draw Card Button:__ 

Every time this button is clicked a new card is displayed, until there are no cards left in the deck.

If the button is clicked when there are no cards remaining, an alert message will appear on the screen with the text “Error: no cards remaining!”.

------------------------------

__Draw Deck Button:__

Part 2: Click to Keep Drawing

When this button is clicked the page will draw one card every second.

These draws will continue until the button is pressed again, or until the deck has been exhausted, at which point the "no cards remaining" message will appear again. 

-----------------------------------

__Shuffle Deck Button:__

Allows a user to start drawing from a full deck without refreshing the page.
